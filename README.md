## Hello, I'm Nastya

In this repository I will write my impressions about Git.

First, I took a course on the website. I liked the course.
At the beginning it was difficult that the material is in English. But everything is okay.
In general, I am satisfied with the course. I actively use the terminal when working with my repositories.

After the course, I completed levels in the game on learngitbranching.js.org. This game is cool.

I also worked a little with additional sources. Really enjoyed TypingClub.

## Hello, I'm Nastya :wave:

I will write my impressions in this repository.

### 1. Git Basics

First, I took a course on the Udacity. I liked the course.
At the beginning it was difficult that the material is in English. But it's okay.
In general, I am satisfied with the course. I actively use the terminal when working with my repositories.

After the course, I completed levels in the game on learngitbranching.js.org. This game is cool. :+1:

I also worked a little with additional sources. Really enjoyed TypingClub. :woman_technologist:
